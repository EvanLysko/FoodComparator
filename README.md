* Check for popular grocery store chains and or other grocery store search types nearby to get locations like walmart, costco, etc to pop up
* Obtain useful info about places on api including their url/websites, address, hours of operation, crowd-level etc
* Make webscraping modules for most popular grocery stores first
* gather prices of searched item
* display to user
* eventually make it a database that auto updates every day with the most commonly searched items at most popular stores cached
